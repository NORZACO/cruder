# RESTful API Methods

- **Create**: Use the HTTP `POST` method to create a resource in a REST environment.
- **Read**: Use the `GET` method to read a resource, retrieving data without altering it.
- **Update**: Use the `PUT` method to update a resource.
- **Delete**: Use the `DELETE` method to remove a resource from the system.

## Testing

To test our `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests, we can use a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or a [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=thunder-client.thunder-client) like Thunder Client to send the HTTP requests. Alternatively, you can use [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/), a command-line tool that is already available on your terminal.
